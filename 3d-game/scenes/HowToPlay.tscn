Objective:
Finish the track as fast as possible. Drift to build boost, use boost on straights, and try to beat your best time or your ghost.

Basic Controls:
W – Accelerate
S – Reverse (15% max speed)
A / D – Steer Left / Right
Space – Drift (reduced friction and builds boost)
E – Use Boost
R – Restart the Race
Esc – Pause / Back to Menu

Drifting:
Hold Space while steering to drift.
Drifting lowers friction, lets you take tighter turns, and charges your boost meter.

Boost:
Press E to use your stored boost.
Boost is most effective on straightaways and when exiting corners.

Ghost Racer:
Enable the ghost to race against your best run.
The ghost replays your fastest time.
If you set a new best time, the ghost updates.
Ghost files can be shared between players.

HUD Elements:
Timer – Shows your current run time
Lap Counter – Current lap / total laps
Boost Bar – Your current boost amount
Best Time – Your fastest time recorded on the track

Tips:
• Drift early to maintain speed.
• Use boost out of corners or on long straights.
• Avoid hitting walls — it kills your speed.
• Press R to instantly restart a bad run.
